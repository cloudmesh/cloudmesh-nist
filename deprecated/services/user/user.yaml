  description: |-
  
    Services need to specify which users have access to them. User
    information can be reused in other services. Users are useful to
    create virtual organization the depend on user data.  Users can
    be added, removed and listed. A group in the user can be used
    to augment users to be part of one or more groups.  A number of
    roles can specify a specific role of a user.
    
    Terminology

    * *Group*: A user can be part of a Group
    * *Role*: A user can have a role within that Group
