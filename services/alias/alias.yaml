  title: Alias
  description: |-

    A user may be interested to create an alias for a resource. This
    is a name useful to the user. A User can deploy a service in which
    such aliasses are stored. The aliasses could naturally be shared
    with other users. A resource could have one or more aliasses.  The
    reason for an alias is that a resource may have a complex name but
    a user may want to refer to the resource using a name that is
    suitable for the user's application.
