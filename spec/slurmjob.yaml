  title: Batch Job
  description: |-
  
    Computing jobs based on a slurm script that can be run on a remote
    slurm cluster without end user interaction are called Slurm jobs.
    Slurm jobs are helpful to minimize the user's interaction with the
    slurm workload manager and allows seamless communication to the remote
    server. The script as well as the accompanied files are automatically
    transfered to the remote slurm cluster and results are automatically
    collected when ready.
