  description: |-

    Services need to specify which users have access to them. User
    information can be reused in other services and organized in a virtual
    organization. A user can be added to a named list of users. A group
    associated with the user can be used to augment users to be part of one or
    more groups. The following terminology is distinguished

    * *Group*: A user can be part of a group.
    * *Organization*: An organization the user belongs to.

    Typically an organization has multiple groups.
