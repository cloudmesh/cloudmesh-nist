   A security group defines the incoming and outgoing security rules
   which can then be assigned to a node. The connection to and from the node
   will be determined by the security group rules, in addition to any other
   possible rules applied on network devices or from the instance's firewall
   settings. A security group may have one or multiple rules and a node may be
   associated with one or more security groups.
