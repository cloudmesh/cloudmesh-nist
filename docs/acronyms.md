# Acronyms and Terms

The following acronyms and terms are used in this volume.

ACID

: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

API

: Application Programming Interface

ASCII

: American Standard Code for Information Interchange

BASE

: Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency

Container

: See
  <http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-180/sp800-180_draft.pdf>

Cloud Computing

: The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted
  on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local
  server or a personal computer. See
  <http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf>.

DevOps

: A clipped compound of software DEVelopment and information
  technology OPerationS

Deployment

: The action of installing software on resources

HTTP

: HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTPS HTTP Secure

Hybrid

: Cloud See <http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf>.

IaaS

: Infrastructure as a Service SaaS Software as a Service

ITL

: Information Technology Laboratory

Microservice Architecture

: Is an approach to build applications based on
  many smaller modular services. Each module supports a specific goal and
  uses a simple, well-defined interface to communicate with other sets of
  services.

NBD-PWG

: NIST Big Data Public Working Group

NBDRA

: NIST Big Data Reference Architecture

NBDRAI

: NIST Big Data Reference Architecture Interface

NIST

: National Institute of Standards and Technology

OS

: Operating System

REST

: REpresentational State Transfer

Replica

: A duplicate of a file on another resource to avoid costly
  transfer costs in case of frequent access.

Serverless Computing

: Serverless computing specifies the paradigm of
  function as a service (FaaS). It is a cloud computing code execution
  model in which a cloud provider manages the function deployment and
  utilization while clients can utilize them. The charge model is based on
  execution of the function rather than the cost to manage and host the VM
  or container.

Software Stack

: A set of programs and services that are installed on a
  resource to support applications.

Virtual Filesysyem

: An abstraction layer on top of a distributed physical
  file system to allow easy access to the files by the user or
  application.

Virtual Machine

: A VM is a software computer that, like a physical
  computer, runs an operating system and applications. The VM is composed
  of a set of specification and configuration files and is backed by the
  physical resources of a host.

Virtual Cluster

: A virtual cluster is a software cluster that integrate
  either VMs, containers, or physical resources into an agglomeration of
  compute resources. A virtual cluster allows users to authenticate and
  authorize to the virtual compute nodes to utilize them for calculations.
  Optional high-level services that can be deployed on a virtual cluster
  may simplify interaction with the virtual cluster or provide
  higher-level services.

Workflow

: The sequence of processes or tasks

WWW

: World Wide Web
